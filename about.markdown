    <p>This project was developed for the Social Data Analysis and Visualization course at DTU as the final project, and explores UFO sightings across the United States through data — where they happen, when they peak, and what people report seeing. Using geospatial, temporal, and textual analysis, we reveal:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hotspots</strong> of sightings and their overlap with military bases</li>
        <li><strong>Trends over time</strong>, linked to cultural and political events</li>
        <li><strong>Common descriptions</strong>, shapes, and colors from eyewitness reports</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our goal is to let the data tell the story — sparking curiosity about what patterns lie behind the unknown.</p>
