Hello everyone! My name is Raquel and I am origionally from Portugal.

I moving to Copenhagen when I was 17 years old and have been living here so far :D Currently doing my masters at DTU and, if everything goes to plan, I will be going to exchange in Australia in a few month wooop woooop

If you knwo anything about me, you know I love to travel. So here is all the countries I have gone to so far and my favorite thing about my vacatin there:

ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ > HOME, prettiest ever, it has so much to see, eat and interact. \\
ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· > Went there on a school trip on 9th grade, LOVE the monuments and architecture. Would love to come back. \\
ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ > Good vibes, food and weather. Have visited a couple times and would really like to keep doing so. \\
ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª > Very very quick trip, had the time of my life at a concert but the weather was giving depression. \\
ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± > Amsterdam was amazing and so different to what I was used to. Strongly thought about moving there, people were great. \\
ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡» > So far the only time I went beyond the limits of europe, super relaxing and fun times. Loved every second at the beach. \\
ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° > Dont think I woudl rather do my studies/work anywhere else, besides weather, so so great, welcoming and fun. \\
ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º > Lovely trip, so much to see and understand. Exceeded my expectations and loved all sites we explores. Food sucks tbh.
