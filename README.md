# ðŸ‘½ UFO Sightings Through Time Across the USA

## Project Overview

This project explores the fascinating world of UFO sightings in the United States through a data-driven lens. It was developed as part of the 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization course at DTU, by **Group 53**:
- InÃªs Tacanho (s232669)
- Raquel Marques (s243636)
- Sree Keerthi Desu (s243933)

By analyzing UFO sighting records, we investigate where and when people report seeing UFOs and what patterns emerge in the language they use. Using a mix of geographic, temporal, and text analysis, this project aims to make sense of the data behind the mystery.

### Our research questions:

1. **Where** are UFO sightings most commonly reported in the U.S.?
2. **When** have sightings occurred most frequently, and how have trends changed over time?
3. **What** do people describe in these sightings? Are there recurring shapes, colors, or motion patterns?
