    For decades, UFO sightings have captured the imagination of people all over the world. What once seemed like fantastical stories of strange lights in the sky has become a growing field of research, sparking debate, curiosity, and wonder. But behind the anecdotes and rumors, lies a wealth of data. In this project, we dive deep into the history of UFO sightings in the United States, analyzing trends, patterns, and anomalies through the lens of data.

    Our analysis dives deep into a dataset of UFO sightings from across the United States, spanning several decades. Through visualizations, we aim to answer these questions:
     
    <ul>
      <li>Where are UFO sightings most commonly reported in the U.S.?</li>
      <li>How have UFO reports changed over time, and what external factors might influence these trends?</li>
      <li>What do people typically report seeingâ€”what shapes, movements, or experiences recur?</li>
      <li>Could movie releases or news coverage be influencing sighting reports? COULD BE FUN </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Geographic Hotspots: Mapping the Sightings</h2>
    One of the first things we wanted to understand is where these sightings are happening. By mapping the geographical spread of UFO encounters, we can begin to see clear patterns and "hotspots" where sightings occur more frequently.

  <div class="main-content">
    We are able to notice areas like southern California and Arizona and North Washington showing more concentrated sightings. But what makes these locations so popular? Are they simply larger, more populated areas, or is there something about these regions that makes them more prone to UFO encounters?
