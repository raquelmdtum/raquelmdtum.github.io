    For decades, UFO sightings have captured the imagination of people all over the world. What once seemed like fantastical stories of strange lights in the sky has become a growing field of research, sparking debate, curiosity, and wonder. But behind the anecdotes and rumors lies a wealth of data. In this project, we analyze UFO sighting data from across the United States to explore how these phenomena are distributed in space, time, and human description.

    For decades, UFO sightings have captured the imagination of people all over the world. What once seemed like fantastical stories of strange lights in the sky has become a growing field of research, sparking debate, curiosity, and wonder. But behind the anecdotes and rumors, lies a wealth of data. In this project, we dive deep into sighting data of UFOs across the United Statesto to explore how these phenomena are distributed across space, time, and their percpetions to humans.

    Through visualizations, we aim to answer these questions:
     
    <ul>
      <li><b>Where</b> are UFO sightings most commonly reported in the U.S.?</li>
      <li><b>When</b> have sightings occurred most often, and how have trends evolved over time?</li>
      <li><b>What</b> do people describe in these sightings? Are there common shapes, behaviors, or terms?</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Geographic Hotspots: Where Are UFOs Seen?</h2>
    One of the first things we wanted to understand is where these sightings are happening. By mapping the geographical spread of UFO encounters, we can begin to see clear patterns and "hotspots" where sightings occur more frequently.

    We are able to notice areas like southern California and Arizona and North Washington showing more concentrated sightings. But what makes these locations so popular? Are they simply larger, more populated areas, or is there something about these regions that makes them more prone to UFO encounters?
    <br>
    When cross-referenced with U.S. population density in the BELOW GRAPH, there is a clear correlation: more populous areas tend to report more sightings. However, some regions—such as parts of rural Washington—exceed expectations, suggesting that other factors like local culture, visibility, or even regional belief systems might play a role.

    <br>
    To explore this further, we compare UFO hotspots with known U.S. military bases. Interestingly, some clusters appear in proximity to major military installations, raising questions about the influence of aircraft testing or heightened surveillance.

    <h2>2. Temporal Trends: When Are UFOs Seen?</h2>
    
    Understanding the timing of sightings can offer insight into public interest, media influence, or political context. Below, we chart the number of sightings over time alongside the sitting U.S. president.

    Looking at UFO sightings across decades a steady and slow rise among the 1960s, there is also a dramatic increase beginning in the 1990s and peaking in the early 2010s. Some of these spikes align closely with major cultural, political, and technological moments, suggesting that these reports may not just reflect unexplained phenomena, but also mirror societal moods, pop culture narratives, and platforms where stories can be shared.

    <ul>
    <li><b>1960s–1980s:</b> The steady climb begins in the Cold War era, marked by space race milestones, conspiracy theories, and increasing interest in UFOs as part of popular culture. This era set the stage for the widespread cultural obsession with extraterrestrial life, a trend that has persisted into modern media and culture. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jun/25/how-pop-culture-has-shaped-our-understanding-of-aliens" target="_blank">The Guardian discusses how pop culture, including these shows, shaped our collective understanding of aliens and UFOs.</a></li>

    <li><b>Late 1990s:</b> UFO sightings during this period, such as the Phoenix Lights (1997) and Gulf Breeze sightings (1995), were covered by the media and spiked curiosity among the population about possible alien encounters. This was also a time of increased discussion about government cover-ups and classified military information, amplified by the rise of the internet as a space for conspiracy theories to flourish. Research has shown that major UFO events in the late 20th century significantly shaped our understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena as a culture, helping to drive the ongoing "UFO boom" that peaked in the 2010s. <a href="https://newspaceeconomy.ca/2024/09/02/timeline-of-major-ufo-uap-events/" target="_blank">NewSpace Economy timeline of major UFO events</a>.</li>

    <li><b>Early 2000s:</b> The surge continues, possibly fueled by post-9/11 anxieties, growing internet communities, and frequent coverage of extraterrestrial topics in popular media. New media outlets like YouTube allowed people to share UFO sightings and related experiences instantly. Additionally, the rise of the internet led to more widespread and immediate public access to information about UFOs encouraging widespread interest. The growing connection between social media platforms and UFO sightings in this period helped facilitate more public participation in UFO-related discourse. This shift was documented in several studies, which discuss how the internet transformed public participation in UFO phenomena, as shown in the article from <em>Nature Communications</em> about the role of digital platforms in the growing interest in UAPs. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-04182-z" target="_blank">Nature Communications Study</a>.</li>

    <li><b>2010–2014:</b> The peak in sightings may reflect both widespread social media use and official military or government statements reigniting public attention toward unidentified aerial phenomena.The U.S. Department of Defense’s public acknowledgment of UFO investigations (including the release of videos in 2017) prompted a renewed public interest, which dovetailed with an increasingly connected world where sightings could be shared instantly across platforms like Twitter and Facebook. This era saw a spike in sightings tied to both increased government transparency and the rapid spread of information through online communities. For example, a study published in <em>Nature</em> discusses the growing number of UAP-related sightings and their analysis through data, showing a correlation between official disclosures and the increase in UAP reports. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49527-x?fromPaywallRec=false#Sec8" target="_blank">Nature Study on UAP</a>.</li>
